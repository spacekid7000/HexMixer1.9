HexMixer1.9 (Databend) is a browser-based audio databending and glitch tool.
It uses JavaScript and the Web Audio API to load, visualize, and destructively process audio buffers with real-time effectsâ€”such as bitcrushing, folding, inversion, randomization, granular and stutter slicing, ring modulation, spectral smear, comb filtering, and more.
Users interact via waveform selection, effect controls, and modals for parameter adjustment.
All processing is non-linear, destructive, and saved locally via IndexedDB.
Undo/redo and WAV export are built-in for fast experimentation.
